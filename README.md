# CLI Based Lexical Language Parser
The goal of this project was to create a program that allows you to input a sentence, and then output whether or not the input sentence is structurally correct in the english language.


- Uses multiple rule files
- Determines the lexical value (Verb, determiner, adjective etc) for each token
- Generates a lexical 'tree', starting from the bottom with the lexical tokens and working upwards
- Outputs wether the input sentence is valid or not
